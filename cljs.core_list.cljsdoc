===== Example#ba7b9b

```
;; Lists can also be constructed literally using quote, but note the difference

;; When using list the arguments are evaluated
(let [x 1 y 2]
  (list x y))
;; => (1 2)

;; ... and when using quote ' they are not:
(let [x 1 y 2]
  '(x y))
;; => (x y)

;; there is syntax quote ` (back tick) that allows selective evaluation inside it with ~:
(let [x 1 y 2]
  `(~x ~y))
;; => (1 2)

;; But syntax quote ` is mostly used in macro definitions where most elements
;; should not be evaluated and unquoted with ~ and list form above feels
;; more idiomatic for simple list construction.
