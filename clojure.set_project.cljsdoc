===== Example

```
;; `project` strips out unwanted key/value pairs from a set of maps. 
;; Suppose you have these descriptions of cows:

user=> (def cows #{  {:name "betsy" :id 33} {:name "panda" :id 34} })
#'user/cows

;; You care only about the names. So you can get them like this:

user=> (project cows [:name])
#{{:name "panda"} {:name "betsy"}}

```
