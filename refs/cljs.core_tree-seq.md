(__tree-seq__ branch? children root)<br>

---

Returns a lazy sequence of the nodes in a tree, via a depth-first walk.

`branch?` must be a function of one argument that returns true if passed a node
that can have children (but may not).

`children` must be a function of one argument that returns a sequence of the
children. `children` will only be called on nodes for which `branch?` returns
true.

`root` is the root node of the tree.

 branch? must be a fn of one arg that returns true if passed a node
 that can have children (but may not).  children must be a fn of one
 arg that returns a sequence of the children. Will only be called on
 nodes for which branch? returns true. Root is the root node of the
tree.
