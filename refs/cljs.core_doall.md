Forces evaluation of a lazy sequence. Often used to see the effects of a
sequence produced via functions that have side effects.

`doall` walks through the successive `next`s of the sequence, returning the head
and causing the entire sequence to reside in memory at one time.

Source docstring:

```
When lazy sequences are produced via functions that have side
effects, any effects other than those needed to produce the first
element in the seq do not occur until the seq is consumed. doall can
be used to force any effects. Walks through the successive nexts of
the seq, retains the head and returns it, thus causing the entire
seq to reside in memory at one time.
```
