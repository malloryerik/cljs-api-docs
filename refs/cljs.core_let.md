 <samp>
(__let__ bindings & body)<br>
</samp>

---

Binds expressions to symbols and makes those symbols available only within
`body`.

`bindings` should be a vector with an even number of forms, ie: `[a1 b1, a2 b2,
a3 b3]`. The first item in a pair (the `a`s) should be a symbol that is assigned
the evaluation of the second item (the `b`s). These symbols (the `a`s) are then
available within `body` (and not outside of `body`).

Another way to think about this is that the binding symbols in `let` are like
local `def`s that are only available within `let`'s scope.

In addition to direct symbol binding, `let` supports a destructuring syntax to
"break apart" collections into multiple symbols. This destructuring syntax is
like it's own [mini-language] and allows for succinct code.

`let` is a wrapper over one of ClojureScript's [special forms] and is a
fundamental building block of the language. Many macros rely on `let`s binding
syntax and scope rules.

Source docstring:

```
binding => binding-form init-expr

Evaluates the exprs in a lexical context in which the symbols in
the binding-forms are bound to their respective init-exprs or parts
therein.
```

     (vector? bindings) "a vector for its binding"
     (even? (count bindings)) "an even number of forms in binding vector")
