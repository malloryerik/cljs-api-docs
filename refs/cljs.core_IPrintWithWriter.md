Source docstring:

```
The old IPrintable protocol's implementation consisted of building a giant
   list of strings to concatenate.  This involved lots of concat calls,
   intermediate vectors, and lazy-seqs, and was very slow in some older JS
   engines.  IPrintWithWriter implements printing via the IWriter protocol, so it
   be implemented efficiently in terms of e.g. a StringBuffer append.
```


Source code @ [github](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/r2156/src/cljs/cljs/core.cljs#L328-L334):

```clj
(defprotocol IPrintWithWriter
  "The old IPrintable protocol's implementation consisted of building a giant

  (-pr-writer [o writer opts]))
