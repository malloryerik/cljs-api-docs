`f` should be a function of 2 arguments. If `val` is not supplied, returns the
result of applying `f` to the first 2 items in `coll`, then applying `f` to that
result and the 3rd item, etc.

If `coll` contains no items, `f` must accept no arguments as well, and `reduce`
returns the result of calling `f` with no arguments.

If `coll` has only 1 item, it is returned and `f` is not called.

If `val` is supplied, returns the result of applying `f` to `val` and the first
item in `coll`, then applying `f` to that result and the 2nd item, etc.

If `coll` contains no items, returns `val` and `f` is not called.
