;; A really goofy way to find the size of a collection
user=> (reduce + (map (constantly 1) [:a :b :c]))
3
```

===== Example#23a54a

```
;; constantly returns a function which always returns the same value
(map (constantly 9) [1 2 3])
user=> (9 9 9)

(map (constantly (rand-int 100)) [:a :b :c])
user=> (43 43 43)
