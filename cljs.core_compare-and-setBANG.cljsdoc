```
;; first we make a demonstration atom
(def a (atom 0))
;; #'user/a 

;; failing to set the demonstration atom because the old-value does not match. 
(compare-and-set! a 10 20)
;;=> false

;; as you can see there was no change to the atom
@a
;;=> 0

;; but when  the old-value matches the atom is set to the new-value.
(compare-and-set! a 0 10)
;;=> true

@a
;;=> 10
