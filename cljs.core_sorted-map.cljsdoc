===== Example

```
(sorted-map :z 1, :b 2, :a 3)   ;;=> {:a 3, :b 2, :z 1}
(into (sorted-map) {:b 2 :a 1}) ;;=> {:a 1, :b 2}
```

===== Example

```
; 'seq' can be used to turn a map into a list of vectors
; notice how the list is built in the sorted order as with vectors.
(seq (into (sorted-map) {:key1 "value1" :key2 "value2"}))
;;=> ([:key1 "value1"] [:key2 "value2"])
```
