```
;; Very useful when working with sequences. Capturing the return value 
;; of `seq` brings a performance gain in subsequent `first`/`rest`/`next`
;; calls. Also the block is guarded by `nil` punning.

(defn drop-one
  [coll]
  (when-let [s (seq coll)]
    (rest s)))

user=> (drop-one [1 2 3])
(2 3)
user=> (drop-one [])
nil

===== Example#89c09c

```
;; Works well with collections

(def x {:whatever 1})

(when-let [value (:whatever x)]
  (println "x+1 = " (inc x)))

;; Prints: "x+1 = 2"
```
